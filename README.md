# Project Title: NLP-based Manipulation Detection
## Final project at Fake News Detection with NLP models course by Gathers (AI HOUSE)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an NLP model that can identify manipulative language in text data, specifically in social media posts and news articles. The model will be trained on a dataset of annotated text examples, and will output a score indicating the degree to which a given text is manipulative.

## Methodology
The project will follow the following methodology:

1. Data collection: Gather a dataset of annotated text data containing examples of manipulative language in social media posts and news articles.
2. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the text data to remove stop words, perform stemming or lemmatization, and convert the text to a numerical format for modeling.
3. Model selection: Evaluate and select an appropriate NLP model for the task of manipulation detection, such as a neural network-based approach or a traditional machine learning algorithm.
4. Model training: Train the selected model on the annotated dataset, using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
5. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. Model deployment: Implement the model in a web application or API that can be used to analyze new text data in real time.
